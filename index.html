                        This project allows the user to interact with a cloth
                        simulation. We created a long banner that hangs in
                        midair and reacts to being pushed, gravity, and wind
                        simulation, with air drag. The camera can be moved
                        freely, allowing the user to closely examine the
                        movement of the cloth.

                        We are using Unity3D Game Engine for the implementation
                        of this project. Using spheres as particles
                        points/positions, we are constructing a cloth by joining
                        them using Line Renderers. Using Unity's Collider
                        System, we are implementing collisions on the cloth by
                        additing Sphere colliders to all spheres that make up
                        the cloth. For the holder of the cloth we are using a
                        free external asset found on SketchFab created by Ez.
                        For air drag applied on the cloth, we are using the air
                        drag equations provided in the lecture slides formulated
                        by Lord Rayleigh.

                        We had difficulties applying the forces in a way that
                        looked natural. Specifically, we had trouble with
                        gravity pulling the cloth beyond what its maximum length
                        should be, making the cloth stretch infinitely. First,
                        we tried to add a correction if the cloth was stretched
                        past its maximum length, but that made the cloth seem to
                        "bounce" at the bottom because the forces were rapidly
                        being applied and removed. Then, we checked the force of
                        the elasticity of the cloth to make sure it was applied
                        correctly. Once we applied the elasticity force, the
                        cloth stopped both stretching infinitely and rapidly
                        seeming to bounce.
